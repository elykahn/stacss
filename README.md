The unobtrusive SCSS framework.

STACSS is a lightweight structured SCSS directory which scaffolds basic styles, variables and indispensable modules.

## Installation

Copy the contents of `/scss` into your application `scss` folder and you are ready to go!

## Info

Note that STACSS requires [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for optimal use. Installing it inside your project is recommended.

STACSS uses [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint) to keep the SCSS files clean. Next to that it uses [csscomb](https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb.js) to automatically enforce linting.

None of the above is required but highly recommended.
