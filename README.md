stacss
======

The unobtrusive SCSS framework.

Stacss is a small SCSS framework that fits any new project. It's intention is to bring you basic stylings you'll need in almost every project which you can continue building upon.

### Installation

Copy the contents of `/scss` into your application `scss` folder and you are ready to go!

### Extra

Note that Stacss requires [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for optimal use. Installing it inside your project is recommended.

I use [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint) to keep my SCSS files clean. Next to that I use [csscomb](https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb.js) to automatically enforce linting.

None of the above is required but highly recommended.
